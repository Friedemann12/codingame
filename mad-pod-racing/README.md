# Mad Pod Racing
This puzzle game starts with a step by step tutorial that will help you get familiar with CodinGameâ€™s multiplayer games. It provides an easy introduction to bot programming through a starship race.

The aim of the game is of course to win the race against other players! To succeed in this challenge, you will be able to use different mathematical concepts such as trajectory calculation, collisions, speed vector, or inertia.

The game is very simple to start. Rules are easy to understand and it only requires a few lines of code to move your ship around.

However, it has near-infinite possibilities of evolution as you can improve your artificial intelligence step by step, while sharpening your coding skills.
