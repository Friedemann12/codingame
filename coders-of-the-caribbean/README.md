# Coders of the Caribbean
This multiplayer puzzle takes place on a hexagonal grid, in which you move your units (boats) and have to collect as much rum as possible to survive. Between shooting at the enemy with cannon, collecting rum or avoiding mines, your pirates will have to make choices ... or do everything at the same time, at their own risk!
